<p class="bloggin">Used Hack Club's <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/">personal site workshop</a> to step through making <i>this</i> thing. The experience felt similar to when I was learning to make a Slack bot: frustration and confusion with the new software and workflows-- often introduced without context or rationale. Is this programming?</p>

  <p class="blogtitle">in preparation for what</p>
      <p class="bloggin">So much has changed in the years since I used to handcode my personal site. I've been feeling impatient with having to re-learn css and html, but today my desire for <i>this</i> thing to look un-shite won me over. Happy to see how fonts work nowadays (google's, for one). Had a lot of fun with my title: an <a href="https://github.com/justvanrossum/nabla">isometric COLRv1 font called nabla</a> that allows you to <i>really</i> mess around with it in css. </p>
