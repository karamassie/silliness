105mins of that man talking, and 0 hands on. No context for Scratch.</p>

<p class="bloggin">Used Hack Club's <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/">personal site workshop</a> to step through making <i>this</i> thing. The experience felt similar to when I was learning to make a Slack bot: frustration and confusion with the new software and workflows-- often introduced without context or rationale. Is this programming?</p>

  <p class="blogtitle">in preparation for what</p>
      <p class="bloggin">So much has changed in the years since I used to handcode my personal site. I've been feeling impatient with having to re-learn css and html, but today my desire for <i>this</i> thing to look un-shite won me over. Happy to see how fonts work nowadays (google's, for one). Had a lot of fun with my title: an <a href="https://github.com/justvanrossum/nabla">isometric COLRv1 font called nabla</a> that allows you to <i>really</i> mess around with it in css. </p>

      <p class="bloggin">I've been saying aloud (for accountability) that I'm going to do every Hack Club workshop. It's a good idea-- for my own programming journey, so I can appreciate others', and to deepen my understanding of our offerings vs other org's. Tonight, as I started our <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/splatter_paint/">splatterpaint workshop </a>in earnest, I found myself happily tumbling down a rabbithole of discovery: <a href="https://puckey.studio/">like this</a> and <a href="https://qianqian-ye.com/">this</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/">this tool.</a></p>
      <p class="bloggin">But happy distraction aside, is this what I want to do? What <i>do</i> I want to do? Because <b>that</b> is what will keep me learning.</p>

  <p class="blogtitle">I AM THAT</p>
      <p class="bloggin">Finish my <a href="https://github.com/karamassie/madcatbot">ornery cat-bot</a> is what. So far the cat:
     <ul>
      <li>grumps, skitters, fusses, farts, causes havoc, or whatever else amuses me when I feel like it </li>
    <li>responds to the few people that it tolerates</li>
  <li>responds (mostly negatively) to some key words</li>
  </ul>
<p class="bloggin">Next I want it to develop 'affinity', as in it tracks the number of times a Slack user does one of the very few things it 'likes' vs all the things that it doesn't</p>
<p class="bloggin">So. I need a leaderboard aka dbase. <a href="https://kognise.dev">Kognise</a> recommends<a href="https://sequelize.org/"> sequelize</a> and SQLite. </p> 
<p class="bloggin">... oh joy. I don't even understand the introductory paragraph. Anyway, onwards.</p>
